# DiscordHelloBot
My first attempt at creating a Discord bot

Has the following commands:
  !greet : responds with "Hello World!"
  !hello : responds with "Hello <your name>"
  !roll <number> : responds with a random number from 0 to <number>
  /hello : responds with "Hello!"

The access token should be stored in token.txt in the project directory.
